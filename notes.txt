make each checker an object

-this._currentPosition
-this._nextPosition
-this._color
-this._emitSound

-this._positionHistory = { 1:[0,2], 2:[0,3], etc.. }

-this._offboard = true/false
-this._cycle = true/false


algorithms:
1/when off the table

this._currentPosition > N or < 0 


2/when in a cycle

//use underscore or something, 

when any entry in this._positionHistory repeats, that means a cycle 

is entered

-have this._color update to something cool/flashing/etc


//make a falling sound when checker falls of


//make the mario bros yellow star sound when a checker gets into a 

cycle


///how to deal with checkers piling up if multiple get on track?



board/ will need to have a refresh function that calls each checker 

to updatePosition() and then updateStatus() which checks against 

algorithms 1 and 2


-deploy it as a gh-pages branch behind michael-crockett.com/
